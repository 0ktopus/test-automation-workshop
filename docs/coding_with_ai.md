# Coding with AI

We created the skeleton of the workshop sample application using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). The stretch goal function (i.e. Clear Completed) was built with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

## Tips on using ChatGPT

- Start with the basic thing.
- Layer on the complexity in the same context.
- Context helps ChatGPT give you better answers.
- ChatGPT's answers are not perfect:
    - We had to refine and adjust the suggested implementation to meet our needs.
    - It sometimes hallucinates and gives you imaginary / plausible sounding solutions that do not work.
    - Make sure to run the code to verify that its behaving correctly.

## GitHub Copilot

- Comment blocks as prompts.
- `Tab` to accept suggestions.
- Context helps Copilot give you better answers.
    - Open up all the relevant / related files in the editor.
