# Exercise 8: Intro to the Playwright End to End Test

We will be using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) to build our end-to-end (E2E) test. Playwright is a cross-browser, cross-platform and cross-language tool for creating end-to-end tests for your web browser.

We can write the E2E test files using [JavaScript](#javascript), [Python](#python) or [Java](#java).

> **Note:** Make sure both the frontend and backend app are running (refer to [exercise 7](./exercise7.md) for instructions) before you start the E2E tests.

> **Note:** Remember to delete all the To Do List Items before you run the E2E tests below. <br> (**Pro-Tip**: Try restarting the **"Backend App"**.)

Skip to the portion for your preferred programming language:

- [JavaScript](#javascript)
- [Python](#python)
- [Java](#java)

## JavaScript

### Running the End to End Test (via [Test Explorer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/testing#_automatic-test-discovery-in-test-explorer))

1. Click on the **"Testing"** icon on the left sidebar.

3. On the row with `js` label, click on the **"Play"** button to run the unit tests.

4. You should see a bunch of green ticks to signify that all the tests are passing.

### Exploring the E2E tests

You can view & edit the E2E test files (files with `*.spec.js` extension) in `End-to-End Tests` > `tests`.
