# Test Automation Workshop

## Background

I'm preparing for a workshop on test automation. It mainly consists of a hands-on lab where participants will learn about different kinds of test automation tools used in software engineering. Specifically for full-stack web development.

## Concept

Through this workshop, I aim to introduce the different testing tools used by modern full-stack software engineers in developing web applications.

We will cover the tests used in Unit Testing, Integration Testing and End-to-End testing.
